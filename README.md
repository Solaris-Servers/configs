## Notice

This is a collection of Confogl matchmodes maintained by [Solaris Servers](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SolarisServers).

The collection is provided "AS IS". There is almost no chance that anything will get updated or will be explained.


### Stripper

Not all of the matchmodes have their Stripper configs included in this repository, only those which require a unique Stripper config function. If you encounter a matchmode that references non-existent Stripper config (e.g. `stripper/vanilla/*`), then just replace it with the one you find most appropriate for the game mode.

### sm_plugins

Why all configs use some weird `sm_plugins_*` syntax? You can find out what's that about [here](https://github.com/keyCat/sourcemod-scripting/tree/master/plugins/plugin_unload_protect).

TL;DR feel free to run a replace from `sm_plugins_` to `sm plugins ` if you don't plan on using `plugin_unload_protect` plugin.
