// First version was released in 2014 as demo version and can be found in YouTube only.
// Current Vertigo has been totally changed and improved.
// Perfect area for speedrunners or kz-players.
// This map is made out of props and included into c8m5_rooftop.
// Vertigo is considered enough difficult!
// To fully enjoy the game and complete the map, you must have some basic movement and bunnyhop skills.
// Good luck!
